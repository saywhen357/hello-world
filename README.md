# hello-world

At 50 I finally decided to learn to create programs.

I have started with a simple ping program for work and it has grown into a beast that is able to perform DB searches.  I created different type of DB searches that helps my team use the program functionality on many tasks we have daily. It has become a tool that simply no other single piece of software can replace. We no longer need to go into our DB suite to create a specialized search for an outage, or check that new system have been properly entered into the DB. It can still ping but it does so much more, it can perform multiple pings simultaneously and provide the user with a truncated result. 

My biggest issue has been the programming code I choose, Python. It was due to several reasons I choose Python.  First being it was introduced by a vendor in our newest network monitoring tool suite. Second, my employer sent me to a course to learn Python coding specifically to help improve our ability to deploy scripts for large network changes. Finally we had several interns come thru our organization that touted the overall robustness of Python.  "Good tool for many uses, great and few."
